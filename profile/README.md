# Mission Statement

## Mission

Our mission is to develop a well-tested software solution for topological optimization of 3D printable artifacts.
Dedicated to provide engineers, designers, and manufacturers with a powerful tool that solely optimize mechanical structures.
Our software aims to empower users to create lighter, more efficient, and cost-effective artifacts while maintaining or
improving their structural integrity.

## Vision

Our vision is to be at the forefront of usable topological optimization technology, implementing the most stable solution in the field.

## Goals

1. Develop an easy-to-use software interface that allows users to import CAD models and define optimization constraints.

2. Implement advanced topological optimization algorithms capable of generating optimal structures for a wide range of mechanical 
artifacts.

3. Provide comprehensive analysis tools, including stress analysis and performance metrics, to ensure the integrity and functionality 
of optimized designs.

4. Support collaboration by enabling seamless sharing and version control of projects.

5. Continuously improve the software through updates and user feedback to stay ahead of industry trends and emerging technologies.

6. Foster a community of users and experts who can exchange knowledge and best practices in topological optimization.
